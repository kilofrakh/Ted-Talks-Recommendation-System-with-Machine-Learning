# TED Talks Recommendation System with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning-based recommendation system to suggest TED Talks based on user preferences and content similarity.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends TED Talks based on text similarity.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to analyze talk descriptions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insights into TED Talks trends.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Talk titles, descriptions, and speaker information.
- Tags, views, likes, and other metadata.

## Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kilofrakh/Ted-Talks-Recommendation-System-with-Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Ted-Talks-Recommendation-System-with-Machine-Learning
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to generate recommendations.

## Model Performance
- **Cosine Similarity for Content-Based Recommendations**
- **TF-IDF Feature Extraction**
- **Evaluation using Precision and Recall**

## Future Enhancements
- Adding collaborative filtering techniques
- Deploying as a web-based recommendation system
- Improving NLP techniques for better recommendations
