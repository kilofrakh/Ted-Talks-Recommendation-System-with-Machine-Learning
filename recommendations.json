                "3623": "A realistic vision for world peace Nobel Peace laureate Jody Williams brings tough love to the dream of world peace, with her razor-sharp take on what \"peace\" really means, and a set of profound stories that zero in on the creative struggle -- and sacrifice -- of those who work for it.",
                "4215": "\"Peace on Earth\" Guitarist and singer Raul Midon plays \"Everybody\" and \"Peace on Earth\" during his 2007 set at TED.",
                "3341": "Why I chose a gun Peter van Uhm is the Netherlands' chief of defense, but that does not mean he is pro-war. In this talk, he explains how his career is one shaped by a love of peace, not a desire for bloodshed -- and why we need armies if we want peace.",
                "3469": "One day of peace Here's a crazy idea: Persuade the world to try living in peace for just one day, every September 21. In this energetic, honest talk, Jeremy Gilley tells the story of how this crazy idea became real -- real enough to help millions of kids in war-torn regions.",
                "3550": "Teaching with the World Peace Game John Hunter puts all the problems of the world on a 4'x5' plywood board -- and lets his 4th-graders solve them. At TED2011, he explains how his World Peace Game engages schoolkids, and why the complex lessons it teaches -- spontaneous, and always surprising -- go further than classroom lectures can."
